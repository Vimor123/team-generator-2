# Team Generator Programs 2 Electric Boogaloo

Programs that assign any number of people to any number of teams, now with funkier languages

## Premise

Have you ever been with a ridiculously large group of friends and decided that the best way to spend the evening (or any part of the day for that matter) 
is to play casual games in multiple teams, turning your drowsy, boring party into a competative event?

Me neither.

Anyways, in case such a scenario occurs, you will probably find it difficult to divide all your friends into teams. 
Well, not exactly difficult, but rather a bit time-consuming, 2-5 minutes time-consuming.

But, worry not, because these programs will help you split your friends into groups for the event. And save time. Maybe.

Simply compile and run the program in the terminal, type in all the names (all in the same line, divided by a specified delimiter) and type in the number of teams,
and in no time the program will spit out all of the teams which are, of course, fairly and randomly generated. In each team there will be the same number of people, 
or in case the number of people is not divisible by the number of teams, there will be some teams with 1 less player.

Team Generator programs are now also available in C++ (now I'm a real engineer), Lua (*~Roblox death sound effect*) and Kotlin (Android Java).

## P.S.

I'll be paired with all the sexy bears.
